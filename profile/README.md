## GG Summer!
Git Gut in Summer is a collection of projects to practice everything related to coding and project management. We do it for fun, for experience, for learning, and sometimes for our CVs.



### Links & resources
TODO: Add links to some repositories with scripts or tools that are useful in the other projects :)
